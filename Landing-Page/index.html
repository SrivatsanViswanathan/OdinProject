            Before I started the Odin Project I had literally ZERO programming
            experience. After almost exactly a year of working through the
            program, I was offered a job as a front end web developer. Odin
            taught me all the most crucial skills in webdev and gave me an
            incredibly strong foundation for branching out and learning other
            pieces of the web-dev puzzle along the way.

            TOP smoothed out the steep learning curve in web development,
            allowing me to confidently learn at my own pace and taught me how to
            approach and solve real-life programming problems. The projects in
            TOP were a perfect mix of difficulty, allowing me to gain exposure
            to different technologies and feel challenged without feeling
            overwhelmed. Because of the foundation TOP provided, I was able to
            easily transition into freelancing and then into a junior level
            Rails developer position.
