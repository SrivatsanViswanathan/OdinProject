      <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes, undrained</li>

      <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
        sheet with foil. Coat a wire rack with nonstick cooking spray, set on
        prepared baking sheet, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, egg, parsley, Worcestershire sauce,
        garlic powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a
        large bowl. Using a 2-teaspoon cookie scoop, shape the mixture into
        1-inch balls and place on the baking rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion
        and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes,
        chicken broth, potatoes, carrots, peas, basil, and red pepper flakes;
        stir until well combined. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low,
        and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes and carrots are cooked and the
        broth has somewhat reduced, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in meatballs and simmer until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
        Season stew with salt and pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
